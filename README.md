# greyhead_encrypted_field
Allows the creation of encrypted fields and labels, with fine-grained permission controls over who can see what. This code is very much in-development and probably contains a large quantity of "wth?" and "why's it doing that?" moments, so its use on production sites, and with live data which is important to you, is not advisable just yet :)
